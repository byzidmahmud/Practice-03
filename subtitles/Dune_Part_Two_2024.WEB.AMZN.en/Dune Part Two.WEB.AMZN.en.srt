1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,467
Power over Spice is power over all.

00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:57,650
Imperial Diary. Year
10,191. Third comment.

4
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:04,426
The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
There were no witnesses.

6
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,499
The Harkonnen operation
was perpetrated overnight,

7
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:15,701
without warning or declaration of war.

8
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:20,409
By morning, the Atreides were no more.

9
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,313
All died in the dark.

10
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:33,785
And the Emperor said...

11
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:38,229
nothing.

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,300
Since that night, my father
has not been the same.

13
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,500
Nor have I.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,507
His inaction is difficult
for me to accept.

15
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,739
For, I know he loved Duke
Leto Atreides like a son.

16
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:01,820
But my father's always been guided

17
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:05,617
by the calculus of power.

18
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,758
This would not be the first time

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,326
the Harkonnens have done his dirty work.

20
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,403
In the shadows of Arrakis
lie many secrets...

21
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:25,276
but the darkest of them all may remain.

22
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:28,609
The end of House Atreides.

23
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,859
Sister, Father is dead.

24
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,302
Shouldn't you go back to the stars,

25
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,172
be with him?

26
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:58,903
I'm afraid I won't have enough time
to fix things before your coming.

27
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,710
This world is beyond cruelty.

28
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,385
Enemy.

29
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:11,881
Stay here.

30
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,477
Down. Right.

31
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,094
They're close.

32
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:07,124
Do you hear that?

33
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:11,128
The rats are calling a worm.

34
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,741
Worms!

35
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:22,139
Unit, climb. Now!

36
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,198
Look for wormsign.

37
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,310
We're okay.

38
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,687
Shields!

39
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:43,088
No Shields!

40
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:44,422
I got you, rat.

41
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:04,103
Never stand with your
back towards the open.

42
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:05,971
How many times do I have
to tell you that, huh?

43
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,377
You okay?

44
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,945
- Yeah.
- How 'bout her?

45
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,981
She's fine.

46
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:24,255
They do not usually venture this deep.

47
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,126
They wanna make sure
no Atreides escaped.

48
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,796
You think too much of yourself.

49
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:31,566
No, no, we are in the deep desert.

50
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:34,230
Only Fremen can survive here.

51
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,800
They were here for us, not for you.

52
00:09:36,936 --> 00:09:39,776
Don't worry.

53
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,876
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

54
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,131
Filthy water.

55
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:06,737
It's full of chemicals, but
good enough for cooling systems.

56
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:11,573
Don't let it out.

57
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,872
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,073
Don't let that out.

59
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,242
Don't let it out!

60
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,054
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

61
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,917
Mm-hmm.

62
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:31,927
You fought well...

63
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:34,160
once you woke up.

64
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,365
I wasn't sleeping.

65
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,932
No, no, no. I'll do it.

66
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:16,262
Lor... Lord Rabban.

67
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:18,400
Now that the spice
fields have been secured,

68
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,871
I strongly recommend bringing all
troops out of Fremen territories.

69
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,768
We're losing too many men to the desert.

70
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:25,138
Rats.

71
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,078
- I beg your pardon?
- We're losing men to rats.

72
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:35,017
Fremen! I can't confirm, my Lord.

73
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,888
Communications are
hectic in the open sands.

74
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,088
Your orders were to
control the whole planet.

75
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,488
- We are.
- I see only half of it.

76
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:46,027
As you may recall,

77
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:49,097
the South is uninhabitable, my Lord.

78
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,000
May I suggest you get some rest?

79
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:55,937
Rats! Hairy rats!

80
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,473
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

81
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,443
Kill them all!

82
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,810
Rats!

83
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:50,321
He's asking why we're so late.

84
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:57,402
He thinks you're spies.

85
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,902
You're not welcome here.

86
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,236
- He said...
- I got that.

87
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,805
- Thanks.
- Stay close to me. Hmm?

88
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:27,360
Sietch Tabr.

89
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,246
Jamis! Jamis!

90
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,000
You killed Jamis!

91
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,047
- Spies!
- Witch!

92
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:46,307
Stop! Stop!

93
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,447
They don't know what they're saying.

94
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:54,326
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

95
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,663
Mahdi!

96
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,653
Lisan al-Gaib!

97
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,825
I need your guidance

98
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,533
with the two foreigners.

99
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,162
Give them back to the desert.

100
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,264
I saw the signs.

101
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:17,593
Again.

102
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:23,396
Stilgar, your faith is
playing tricks on you.

103
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,942
The Lisan al-Gaib has
not shown his face yet!

104
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,574
He killed Jamis in a fair fight.

105
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:38,787
He speaks our language.

106
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,456
He will quickly learn our ways.

107
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:47,254
I'm ready to pledge my life for him.

108
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:51,925
The desert will handle his fate.

109
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,806
What about the woman?

110
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,188
Look how your Bene Gesserit
propaganda has taken root.

111
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,160
Some of them already
think I'm their messiah.

112
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,163
Others...

113
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,733
false prophet.

114
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,865
I must sway the non-believers.

115
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,899
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

116
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:25,274
That's the only way I
can get to the Emperor.

117
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,475
Your father didn't believe in revenge.

118
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,576
Yeah, well, I do.

119
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,215
What is happening?

120
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,981
Too spicy for the foreigner?

121
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,256
What is it?

122
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,990
There is spice in the food.

123
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,321
He'll look pretty with blue eyes.

124
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,659
Don't mock him.

125
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,061
He deserves our respect.
He's a good fighter.

126
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:29,239
Woman.

127
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,671
Come with me.

128
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:35,282
To the well,

129
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,283
our water we return.

130
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:39,645
We bless our brother, Jamis.

131
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:45,749
Thirty-eight million decaliters.

132
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:51,688
None of us, even dying of thirst,
would ever drink this water.

133
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,850
This is...

134
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,523
sacred.

135
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,759
Jamis' water.

136
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:05,632
We have a thousand such places.

137
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:09,705
When we have enough water,

138
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,137
the Lisan al-Gaib will
change the face of Arrakis.

139
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:17,314
He will bring back the
trees. He will bring back...

140
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:20,515
a Green Paradise.

141
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:25,051
So many souls.

142
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:39,435
Never give your water away,
not even for the dead. Hmm?

143
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,435
Why are you showing me this?

144
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,175
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

145
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,944
Because you understand the prophecies.

146
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,778
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib
will be a Reverend Mother.

147
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,584
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

148
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:00,317
You want me to take her place?

149
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:03,525
Yes, I do.

150
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,430
You believe in Paul?

151
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,632
There are signs.

152
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,468
Yes.

153
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:17,769
What if I would refuse?

154
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:20,705
Mmm. Then, he's not Lisan al-Gaib,

155
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,780
and you have no purpose to serve.

156
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:26,982
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

157
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,682
Huh.

158
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,555
It's an honor, isn't it?

159
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,558
I think you should feel honored.

160
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:38,593
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

161
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:40,760
so, you know, forgive
me if I'm not flattered.

162
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,335
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

163
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,334
It's different from
one culture to another.

164
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,570
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

165
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,776
You're afraid.

166
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,711
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

167
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:58,581
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

168
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:02,078
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

169
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:03,921
Is it dangerous?

170
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,423
It's lethal for men.

171
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,552
That's for sure.

172
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:19,028
What are you guys laughing about?

173
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,398
Don't bother.

174
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,465
You don't believe in all this?

175
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,933
No, we don't.

176
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:30,039
These are old Southern beliefs.

177
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:31,942
Southern beliefs?

178
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,479
Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

179
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,576
You don't believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

180
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:40,116
We believe in Fremen.

181
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,084
Amen.

182
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:45,214
You want to control people, you
tell them a messiah will come.

183
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,192
- Mm-hmm.
- Then they'll wait for centuries.

184
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:55,631
Now, we must pray.

185
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:04,067
What about him?

186
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,708
- Stilgar?
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,640
He's from the South. You
didn't notice his accent?

188
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:19,155
What'll happen to my mother?

189
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,352
She'll drink worm piss.

190
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:22,889
Not funny.

191
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:24,919
He's about to lose her.

192
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,164
If she's stupid enough to drink poison.

193
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:33,594
Shut up! We are praying.

194
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:44,043
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.

195
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:47,250
Fear, the little death that
brings total obliteration.

196
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,146
I will face my fear. I will...

197
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:57,858
Here is the Water of Life.

198
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,372
It frees the soul.

199
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:03,750
If you drink...

200
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,127
you shall die.

201
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:11,591
If you drink...

202
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,509
you may see.

203
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,612
Drink!

204
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,215
What is it?

205
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,216
Drink!

206
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,093
What have we done?

207
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,669
She is pregnant.

208
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,778
- That was no miracle!
- You saw it with your own eyes!

209
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:05,994
The Mother of the Lisan al-Gaib

210
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:08,400
shall survive the Holy Poison.

211
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,293
And She did.

212
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:13,829
As written!

213
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:16,007
Her people wrote that!

214
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:17,842
Blasphemy.

215
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:19,635
The prophecy has been accomplished.

216
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:22,430
The Mahdi must be Fremen!

217
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,575
Arrakis must be freed by its own people!

218
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,209
She's right. She's right!

219
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,410
It's no miracle.

220
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,386
My mother was trained to do that.

221
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:41,824
Poison transmutation is something
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

222
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,422
I'm not the Mahdi.

223
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:51,295
I'm not here to lead.

224
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:56,464
I'm here to learn your ways.

225
00:27:57,304 --> 00:28:00,744
Let me fight beside you.
That's all I'm asking.

226
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,971
The Mahdi is too humble

227
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:13,770
to say He is the Mahdi.

228
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:16,776
Even more reason to know He is!

229
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,862
As written!

230
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,131
How are you?

231
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:27,166
Better.

232
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:29,267
How is she?

233
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,402
She was frightened, but she's...

234
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:35,075
she's okay.

235
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,181
Paul.

236
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:47,120
She talks to me.

237
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:51,855
She believes in you.

238
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:56,833
She says...

239
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,069
Kwisatz Haderach, show us the way.

240
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,870
You're so close now.

241
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:10,374
Only one step remains and you
will become the Kwisatz Haderach.

242
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,245
Only one step remains.

243
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,344
You must do what I did.

244
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,683
You must drink the Water of Life.

245
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:22,892
And your mind, it's gon... it's
gonna open and you will see.

246
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,389
You will see!

247
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:29,181
The beauty and the horror!

248
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:38,474
If you wanna fight with us,
first thing, you must learn

249
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,536
to be one with the desert.

250
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:45,245
So, here is a tent and enough food.

251
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:50,315
I want you to cross that
small erg and come back.

252
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,348
Travel by night.

253
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:54,049
You know how to use a paracompass?

254
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:55,353
- Yes.
- Oh.

255
00:29:58,322 --> 00:29:59,797
Anything else I should know?

256
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,192
Uh, beside the worms and the Harkonnens,

257
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:05,968
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

258
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,570
Centipedes are very
nasty. Not the big ones.

259
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,273
They are harmless.

260
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:15,241
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And... Oh!

261
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:21,379
Don't ever, ever listen to the jinn.

262
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,222
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

263
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,022
Desert spirits.

264
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:30,823
They whisper at night.

265
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:37,801
They, they can possess you.

266
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:42,169
Really, be careful. They are demons.

267
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:47,207
But it's true. Don't listen to them.

268
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,311
He doesn't know how to cross.

269
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:56,018
Stilgar is going to get him killed.

270
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,050
What is he trying to prove?

271
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:59,318
What do you think?

272
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:04,735
"The Prophet shall know
the ways of the desert."

273
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,036
I think it's for the best.

274
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,331
What's this?

275
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:20,751
You care for him now?

276
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:24,004
He's not like the other strangers.

277
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:26,549
He's sincere.

278
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,162
Jamis.

279
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:19,002
You sandwalk like a drunk lizard.

280
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,436
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good so far.

281
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:26,339
Yeah, well, you're not
even in worm territory yet.

282
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,063
You have to break up your rhythm.

283
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:52,898
Like this.

284
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,803
Now, that's interesting because
in the filmbooks I've studied,

285
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,702
the anthropologists say, in
order to properly sandwalk,

286
00:32:58,703 --> 00:32:59,703
you actually have...

287
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:05,543
Never mind. Please keep going.

288
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,315
You know, I'm the only one who believes

289
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:36,905
you're gonna make it until summer?

290
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,214
Everyone else thinks you
won't make it two weeks.

291
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:41,578
If you wanna follow us in the desert,

292
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:43,212
you need to know how windtraps work.

293
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,881
So, listen to me.

294
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:47,354
They're simple, but they
require constant attention.

295
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:50,654
Uh, this right here,
it captures the moisture

296
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,623
and then it carries it into that pocket.

297
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,494
Uh, and these are the filters.

298
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,497
They need to be changed
every three days.

299
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:01,269
What?

300
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,605
Stop looking at me like that.

301
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:14,379
He's training with the Fremen.

302
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:16,680
He will be back soon. Don't worry.

303
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:18,819
Mm-hmm.

304
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:23,424
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

305
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:26,763
we need all the Fremen to
believe in the prophecy.

306
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:35,699
We must convert the
non-believers one by one.

307
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,374
We need to start with the weaker ones.

308
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:43,278
The vulnerable ones.

309
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,381
The ones who fear us.

310
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:12,868
Hey, get out of here. Go.

311
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,313
- You okay?
- Yeah.

312
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,784
Let's go! Move!

313
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:54,667
Load.

314
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:15,886
Chani!

315
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,931
Reload!

316
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,980
Ugh! Reload.

317
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,115
Oh, watch out!

318
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:57,800
Its shield will only open when it fires.

319
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,501
I know that. What do you
think I'm trying to do?

320
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:02,834
I'll trigger it. On my signal. Be ready.

321
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:26,924
Go!

322
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:30,294
Ah, shit!

323
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,837
Go! Go!

324
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:20,874
You saw what he did.

325
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,212
He saw it coming, and he saved her life.

326
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:27,714
He saw it.

327
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:29,633
He can foresee.

328
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:34,226
Muad'Dib likes his smell.

329
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,500
Who taught you to fight like that?

330
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:44,303
- My old masters.
- Hmm.

331
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,904
They were close friends.

332
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:52,141
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

333
00:40:57,315 --> 00:41:00,589
You've been fighting the
Harkonnens for decades.

334
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,992
My family's been fighting
them for centuries.

335
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:07,991
I know everything about them. Their
habits, their ways of thinking.

336
00:41:08,127 --> 00:41:09,497
You know everything about the desert.

337
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,794
You harness the very power of it.

338
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:17,969
We can stop them together, bury
them in the sand where they belong.

339
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:20,268
So that this planet
can be yours once more.

340
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:24,279
What would you have us do? Huh?

341
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:26,047
What would you do, Stilgar?

342
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:30,318
I? I would... would
strike even further north.

343
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,052
Then I will go further north.

344
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,123
And the further north you go,
the more likely it is you die.

345
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,889
Then I'll die.

346
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:38,535
Maybe you will too.

347
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,539
But the others will keep going.

348
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:46,501
And they won't stop
until the Fremen are free.

349
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:52,424
He deserves to be Fedaykin.

350
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:55,776
He needs names, Stilgar.

351
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:57,387
He does!

352
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:02,117
I see strength in you.

353
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,315
Like Usul.

354
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,813
The base of the pillar.

355
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:08,991
Come, come.

356
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,603
You shall be know among us as Usul.

357
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,204
- Usul.
- Usul.

358
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:30,476
Usul. And now, a Fedaykin is a fighter

359
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:32,010
and needs a war name.

360
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:34,276
You must choose.

361
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,623
How do you call the, uh...

362
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,487
The small desert mouse, again?

363
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:46,624
- Muad'Dib?
- Muad'Dib.

364
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:49,094
No, no, no.

365
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,201
Muad'Dib is wise in
the ways of the desert.

366
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,736
Muad'Dib...

367
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,701
creates his own water.

368
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:01,805
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call Muad'Dib.

369
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,943
"The One Who Points the Way."

370
00:43:05,613 --> 00:43:07,045
That is a powerful name.

371
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:15,752
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

372
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,222
Paul Muad'Dib Usul.

373
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:26,867
Muad'Dib Usul.

374
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:28,770
Muad'Dib Usul.

375
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:31,734
Muad'Dib Usul.

376
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:36,844
Muad'Dib Usul. Mm.

377
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:38,681
Muad'Dib.

378
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:42,850
Usul.

379
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,736
Hey! Stilgar!

380
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:19,221
Father, I found my way.

381
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,674
It's breathtaking.

382
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:47,684
Hmm.

383
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:53,052
Look. Right there. Spice.

384
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:56,220
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

385
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:08,302
Where you're from, does water
really fall from the sky?

386
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:10,234
Oh, hm, yes.

387
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:13,642
Sometimes it rains for weeks on Caladan.

388
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:16,240
Where you see sand here, imagine water.

389
00:45:19,214 --> 00:45:23,214
Our castle stands on
cliffs high above the sea.

390
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:26,185
If you dive in, you
can't reach the bottom.

391
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:30,189
- You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

392
00:45:30,324 --> 00:45:33,228
I don't... I don't believe you, Usul.

393
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,423
Usul.

394
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:38,361
What's your secret name?

395
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:42,129
Sihaya.

396
00:45:42,265 --> 00:45:43,839
- Sihaya.
- Hmm.

397
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:46,737
What does that mean?

398
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,606
Means Desert Spring.

399
00:45:48,741 --> 00:45:50,010
"Desert Spring."

400
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,409
- I love it.
- I hate it.

401
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,445
It's from some stupid prophecy.

402
00:45:57,486 --> 00:45:58,513
I prefer Chani.

403
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,120
I prefer Chani, too, then.

404
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,863
Do you think Stilgar would teach me?

405
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:11,393
- To ride?
- Yeah.

406
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:14,869
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

407
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,669
Well, I thought I'd
become one, didn't I?

408
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:18,874
By name, not by blood.

409
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:25,914
Your blood comes from
Dukes and Great Houses.

410
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:29,950
We don't have that here.

411
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:33,988
Here, we're equal, men and women alike.

412
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,188
What we do, we do for
the benefit of all.

413
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:38,894
Well, I'd very much
like to be equal to you.

414
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:48,365
Paul Muad'Dib Usul...

415
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:52,435
maybe you could be Fremen.

416
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,044
Maybe I'll show you the way.

417
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:27,096
Rabban.

418
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:42,143
Fremen attacks on your watch.

419
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:48,352
Your orders were to restore
spice production to full capacity.

420
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:51,125
Do you know what it means if you fail?

421
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:56,625
The Emperor will take
spice out of our control.

422
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,966
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

423
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,036
Uncle.

424
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:03,665
Or feel mine on your neck.

425
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,216
Usul? Usul.

426
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:24,356
It's okay. It's okay.

427
00:49:27,662 --> 00:49:28,662
Hey.

428
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:34,270
I'm here, I'm here.

429
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,569
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

430
00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:38,705
Mm.

431
00:49:42,342 --> 00:49:44,673
Tell me, what was it about?

432
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:53,752
Nothing's clear. It's only fragments.

433
00:49:55,689 --> 00:50:00,029
I'm in the South, and
I'm following someone.

434
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:03,329
And it triggers a holy war.

435
00:50:06,602 --> 00:50:10,501
Millions and millions of
people starving to death...

436
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,207
because of me.

437
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:21,948
You've been exposed to
spice for a long time.

438
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,047
It can create weird dreams.

439
00:50:31,188 --> 00:50:32,259
It's a big day.

440
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:35,761
We can ask Stilgar to call it off.

441
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:38,562
No. I'm fine.

442
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,546
Usul.

443
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,320
I tuned it myself.

444
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:03,686
- Here.
- Thanks.

445
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:10,330
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

446
00:51:11,096 --> 00:51:13,361
Heh? Be simple.

447
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:16,598
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

448
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:18,767
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

449
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:21,471
Nothing fancy or you
will shame my teaching.

450
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:25,339
I won't shame you. I understand.

451
00:51:25,475 --> 00:51:30,515
Shai-Hulud decides today if you
become Fremen, or if you die.

452
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:39,355
Hey, Muad'Dib!

453
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:42,176
Don't embarrass us!

454
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:43,264
Call a big one!

455
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:48,770
Don't worry.

456
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:50,855
Stilgar taught him well.

457
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:56,442
Enough joking.

458
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,780
This is the final test.

459
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:22,501
Lower.

460
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:49,231
Okay. Okay.

461
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:52,855
Not that big.

462
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:05,439
Okay. Okay. Okay.

463
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:54,048
Okay.

464
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:12,904
Okay. Okay!

465
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,928
Come on!

466
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:50,879
Whoa!

467
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:55,510
You're a rider!

468
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,698
As written.

469
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:01,807
Reverend Mother!

470
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:08,614
Muad'Dib made peace with Shai-Hulud.

471
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,753
He called a grandfather worm.

472
00:58:13,754 --> 00:58:16,949
The biggest ever seen.

473
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:18,554
As written!

474
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:21,115
Shai-Hulud shall bow

475
00:58:21,116 --> 00:58:22,316
to the Boy from the Outer World.

476
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,830
Bless the Maker and His works.

477
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:30,004
Will not Shai-Hulud know
the Mahdi when He comes?

478
00:58:34,717 --> 00:58:36,635
Then share the Word.

479
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:53,595
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I know they do.

480
00:58:56,128 --> 00:58:58,694
Our task in the North is nearly done.

481
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,767
They believe in Paul.

482
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,739
Now we go South.

483
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,235
There are millions of
fundamentalists there.

484
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,106
They will protect him when he comes.

485
00:59:12,378 --> 00:59:16,948
The Kwisatz Haderach
will be born in the South.

486
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,057
Will you always be with me?

487
00:59:30,762 --> 00:59:32,733
As long as I breathe.

488
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,174
What's wrong?

489
00:59:44,212 --> 00:59:46,780
- Chani.
- There will be trouble.

490
00:59:48,748 --> 00:59:50,212
What are you talking about?

491
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:55,355
Chani, what do you mean?

492
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,021
The way they look at you.

493
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,859
They worship you now.

494
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:04,928
The Fedaykin, they count your victories.

495
01:00:05,064 --> 01:00:07,566
They say you can see the future.

496
01:00:07,702 --> 01:00:09,671
Whisper, "Lisan al-Gaib."

497
01:00:10,734 --> 01:00:12,267
I'm no messiah.

498
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:17,909
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

499
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:20,647
Yet, we have a Bene Gesserit among us,

500
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:22,217
fanning the flames of your legend,

501
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,883
saying you're the One.

502
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,400
Mm.

503
01:00:46,535 --> 01:00:48,039
Reverend Mother!

504
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:50,978
Your palanquin is ready!

505
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,143
She says you should be coming with us.

506
01:00:53,844 --> 01:00:55,079
You know I can't.

507
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,113
She's asking why.

508
01:00:57,249 --> 01:00:59,116
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

509
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:01,657
to protect you down there in the South.

510
01:01:03,221 --> 01:01:06,556
She says she can tell when you lie.

511
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:10,391
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

512
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:19,507
What is she saying now?

513
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,942
She says you're blinded by love,

514
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:24,139
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

515
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:26,308
for the most strategic alliance.

516
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:32,219
She's also wondering why you
don't believe in who you are.

517
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,355
I do believe.

518
01:01:33,382 --> 01:01:35,691
I believe I matter to these people.

519
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,288
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

520
01:01:41,128 --> 01:01:42,556
We're nearly at the gates of the city.

521
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:45,461
- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

522
01:01:45,597 --> 01:01:48,236
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

523
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,034
It's not a prophecy.

524
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,772
It's a story that you keep telling,

525
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,841
but it's not their story, it's yours.

526
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:57,076
They deserve to be led
by one of their own.

527
01:01:57,211 --> 01:01:59,812
What your people did to
this world is heartbreaking.

528
01:01:59,948 --> 01:02:01,514
We gave them something to hope for.

529
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,345
That's not hope!

530
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,585
Reverend Mother,

531
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:10,924
we have to go!

532
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,031
I'll be waiting for you.

533
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:21,636
All of us.

534
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,603
All of us.

535
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,612
Those storms look bad.

536
01:03:07,748 --> 01:03:09,785
They're the Guardians of the South.

537
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:14,663
It's a hard crossing,
but Shai-Hulud is strong.

538
01:03:54,594 --> 01:03:56,323
- How much?
- We lost...

539
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:58,826
eighty percent of our last crop.

540
01:03:58,962 --> 01:04:02,729
My Lord Rabban, you should not
leave the security perimeter.

541
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:05,367
Security perimeter? The
rats are already inside.

542
01:04:05,502 --> 01:04:07,441
The Fremen Demon might be with them.

543
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,010
I hope so.

544
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:10,146
We're tracking them, my Lord.

545
01:04:10,944 --> 01:04:13,948
Today, Muad'Dib dies!

546
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:20,119
The rats are travelling fast.

547
01:04:22,314 --> 01:04:24,274
Move!

548
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:56,886
Where is he?

549
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:58,389
Still negative, my Lord.

550
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:00,258
Why do I have to do everything myself?

551
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,193
Open range!

552
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:06,000
Range open.

553
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,504
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

554
01:05:36,763 --> 01:05:38,032
I've lost them.

555
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,270
- Strike!
- Yes, my Lord.

556
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,575
Muad'Dib!

557
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:56,572
Show yourself!

558
01:07:27,038 --> 01:07:31,508
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

559
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,600
For Muad'Dib!

560
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:40,379
Muad'Dib.

561
01:08:42,544 --> 01:08:46,250
Some new Fremen prophet?

562
01:08:46,385 --> 01:08:47,763
It's not the first time

563
01:08:47,764 --> 01:08:49,382
we've had frictions with the Fremen.

564
01:08:49,518 --> 01:08:51,522
None of this magnitude.

565
01:08:55,524 --> 01:08:57,330
So, my dear daughter...

566
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,795
how would you deal with this prophet?

567
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:09,870
If this Muad'Dib is a religious figure,

568
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:13,379
you can't use direct force.

569
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,812
Repression only makes
a religion flourish.

570
01:09:17,947 --> 01:09:20,119
You'll only end up humiliating yourself.

571
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:21,683
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

572
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:24,885
You underestimate the power of faith.

573
01:09:28,391 --> 01:09:32,365
Her Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

574
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:37,203
- You'd send assassins?
- No.

575
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,306
Prophets get stronger when they die.

576
01:09:40,772 --> 01:09:43,275
Let the conflict on
Arrakis turn into war.

577
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:46,775
You then bring peace. As a savior.

578
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,252
You'd be a formidable empress.

579
01:09:55,387 --> 01:09:58,222
Muad'Dib. The prophet.

580
01:09:58,357 --> 01:10:00,726
The one who points the way.

581
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:03,126
These are our own religious
patterns, aren't they?

582
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:04,727
This is our doing.

583
01:10:08,203 --> 01:10:11,138
Muad'Dib means kangaroo mouse.

584
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,373
An unusual war name for a Fremen.

585
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:18,174
- What if Paul Atreides were still alive?
- Enough!

586
01:10:18,309 --> 01:10:22,844
This must not come out. Even to
your father's ears. Understand?

587
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:26,215
I do, Reverend Mother.

588
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:29,684
If Paul is alive, he
likely knows the truth.

589
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,692
And should the Great Houses learn

590
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,824
that your father was behind
the liquidation of the Atreides,

591
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:38,695
your father will face
war and lose the throne.

592
01:10:40,464 --> 01:10:41,995
Then what hope is there?

593
01:10:43,332 --> 01:10:44,404
Hope?

594
01:10:45,672 --> 01:10:50,003
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

595
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,641
Paul is not our only prospect.

596
01:10:54,776 --> 01:10:56,967
The Baron's youngest nephew,

597
01:10:56,968 --> 01:11:00,387
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen,
will inherit Arrakis.

598
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,155
He may be the answer.

599
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,925
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

600
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,690
That's irrelevant.

601
01:11:07,825 --> 01:11:12,064
The question is, can we control him?

602
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,796
And I intend to find out.

603
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,657
Would you like some
fresh meat, my darlings?

604
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:43,358
Lungs? Or liver?

605
01:11:43,493 --> 01:11:46,663
What would you like? I
hear they're big today.

606
01:11:46,799 --> 01:11:51,169
Your new blades for
this very special day,

607
01:11:51,304 --> 01:11:54,342
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

608
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,434
A notch off balance.

609
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:25,569
It's the tip.

610
01:12:26,338 --> 01:12:27,667
Should be sharper.

611
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:43,488
Come.

612
01:12:43,623 --> 01:12:45,760
I won't die like a fool.

613
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:46,895
Kill me now.

614
01:12:46,957 --> 01:12:49,826
No drug for you today, Atreides.

615
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,997
Under our glorious black sun,

616
01:12:55,998 --> 01:13:00,498
we welcome to these special festivities

617
01:13:00,874 --> 01:13:04,081
our beloved leader
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

618
01:13:15,305 --> 01:13:20,894
His presence today, watching over
a spectacle of blood and honor,

619
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:28,360
marks the Holy Birthday of our
beloved na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

620
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,901
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

621
01:14:07,037 --> 01:14:09,042
I hope your travels were agreeable.

622
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,475
A long way to come just
to watch our prospect

623
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,444
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

624
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,512
No fear.

625
01:14:15,648 --> 01:14:17,551
These fights are all for show.

626
01:14:18,818 --> 01:14:21,116
But we'll get a good look at him.

627
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:47,581
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

628
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,241
In celebration of our
na-Baron Feyd-Rautha,

629
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:25,226
we present a special treat.

630
01:15:32,108 --> 01:15:36,154
The last three specimens
of House Atreides.

631
01:16:01,753 --> 01:16:02,920
That slave isn't drugged.

632
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:05,758
That bug is walking straight.

633
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:07,989
You should cancel the fight.

634
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,823
Don't spoil my nephew's birthday.

635
01:16:58,546 --> 01:17:01,345
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

636
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:19,727
Why do they not stop the fight?

637
01:17:19,863 --> 01:17:21,632
Plans within plans.

638
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,137
Show me who you are.

639
01:17:44,919 --> 01:17:46,694
There he is.

640
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,070
Back! Back!

641
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:51,852
Stay back!

642
01:19:05,534 --> 01:19:08,171
You have fought well, Atreides.

643
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,338
Hmm.

644
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:24,286
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

645
01:19:29,729 --> 01:19:31,029
He's impressive, indeed.

646
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:35,198
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

647
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:44,812
The slave wasn't drugged.

648
01:19:46,977 --> 01:19:49,309
You tried to kill me.

649
01:19:49,445 --> 01:19:51,912
This morning you were a playboy,

650
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:53,849
feared and envied,

651
01:19:53,985 --> 01:19:57,389
but tonight you're a hero.

652
01:19:57,524 --> 01:19:58,956
My gift to you.

653
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:00,987
I ought to drown you in that tub.

654
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:04,762
Don't be hasty.

655
01:20:04,897 --> 01:20:07,432
I have another gift for you.

656
01:20:07,568 --> 01:20:08,935
A bigger one.

657
01:20:10,437 --> 01:20:11,900
Arrakis.

658
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,341
What about Rabban?

659
01:20:17,477 --> 01:20:19,842
He has failed to
protect spice production.

660
01:20:19,978 --> 01:20:22,344
Rabban will be reassigned.

661
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:28,920
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

662
01:20:29,056 --> 01:20:31,859
Free the spice. I'll make you Emperor.

663
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:46,005
Emperor?

664
01:20:49,003 --> 01:20:50,174
How?

665
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:55,245
The Emperor helped me
destroy the Atreides.

666
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,253
He lent his own army to the cause.

667
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:01,421
A serious crime.

668
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:06,157
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

669
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:08,192
And then...

670
01:21:09,258 --> 01:21:11,899
who will sit on the throne?

671
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:15,903
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

672
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:57,274
You're following me.

673
01:21:58,644 --> 01:21:59,672
Am I?

674
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,181
I may have gotten lost.

675
01:22:04,948 --> 01:22:10,056
Will you show me the way out
of this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

676
01:22:17,094 --> 01:22:19,461
We've met, haven't we?

677
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:24,037
I don't think so.

678
01:22:24,805 --> 01:22:27,105
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

679
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:29,436
I'm here to honor your coming of age.

680
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:31,539
You're not allowed in this section.

681
01:22:32,475 --> 01:22:33,974
How did you get past the guards?

682
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:35,510
The guards?

683
01:22:38,285 --> 01:22:40,383
May I ask, what are you doing here?

684
01:22:42,455 --> 01:22:46,092
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations?

685
01:22:56,236 --> 01:22:58,766
You're Bene Gesserit.

686
01:22:58,902 --> 01:23:01,873
And what makes you say that?

687
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:04,371
I remember now.

688
01:23:04,506 --> 01:23:06,908
I dreamed about you last night.

689
01:23:07,043 --> 01:23:08,641
A pleasant dream, I hope.

690
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,380
Don't mock me, woman.

691
01:23:10,515 --> 01:23:12,052
I wouldn't dare.

692
01:23:14,188 --> 01:23:17,090
I know your Bene Gesserit tricks.

693
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,686
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

694
01:23:23,597 --> 01:23:24,597
Tell me.

695
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:29,828
Something wrong?

696
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:31,632
I don't recognize this place.

697
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,202
This is the guest wing.

698
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,474
Where are you going?

699
01:23:40,175 --> 01:23:41,345
To my room.

700
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:14,048
Come. To. Me.

701
01:24:17,145 --> 01:24:18,448
Kneel.

702
01:24:32,194 --> 01:24:35,465
Put your right hand in the box.

703
01:24:50,278 --> 01:24:53,817
A sociopath. Of high intelligence.

704
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:55,648
Driven. Cruel.

705
01:24:55,784 --> 01:24:58,257
But strongly motivated by honor.

706
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:01,220
He yearns to be hurt.

707
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:03,196
He loves pain.

708
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,659
Can he be redeemed?

709
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:06,326
He can be controlled.

710
01:25:06,462 --> 01:25:08,432
He's sexually vulnerable.

711
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,605
And?

712
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,603
The bloodline is secured.

713
01:25:16,175 --> 01:25:19,212
Female, as you requested.

714
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:22,282
You did well, Margot.

715
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,812
Respectfully, why didn't
you test him yourself?

716
01:25:27,086 --> 01:25:29,422
I'm a motherly figure.

717
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:33,058
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

718
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,624
I didn't expect to be effective.

719
01:25:35,759 --> 01:25:37,560
What happened between
him and his mother?

720
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:39,232
He murdered her.

721
01:25:40,462 --> 01:25:43,632
Desire and humiliation.

722
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,205
Those are his levers.

723
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:49,603
If Feyd-Rautha prevails on Arrakis,

724
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:52,641
we shall know how to control him.

725
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:07,623
All hail na-Baron Feyd-Rautha!

726
01:26:08,994 --> 01:26:11,163
The new Planetary Governor of Arrakis!

727
01:26:13,331 --> 01:26:15,734
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

728
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:34,183
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

729
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,724
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

730
01:26:38,859 --> 01:26:40,491
Feyd-Rautha!

732

01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:24,733
We're in.

738
01:27:28,403 --> 01:27:29,535
Juicy?

739
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:31,403
Juicy, juicy.

740
01:27:34,009 --> 01:27:35,914
Well, it was nice knowing ya.

741
01:27:36,049 --> 01:27:37,247
Oh, yeah?

742
01:27:37,382 --> 01:27:39,319
Radar's clear. We're clear.

743
01:27:40,516 --> 01:27:42,256
Cooking time.

744
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:03,510
Juicy, juicy.

745
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,338
Yeah, I got a meter reading...

746
01:28:05,474 --> 01:28:07,340
All right, guys, worms are on their way.

747
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:08,641
- Watch out for abrasions.
- Get ready to dock.

748
01:28:08,776 --> 01:28:10,350
It's gonna get hot.

749
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:16,122
Crank 'em up! Throw them up!

750
01:28:45,151 --> 01:28:46,151
Hold!

751
01:29:00,429 --> 01:29:01,901
Mine! Mine!

752
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:03,464
Get moving!

753
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,036
- East! East!
- Get clear!

754
01:29:16,482 --> 01:29:18,313
Let's get out of here!

755
01:29:18,448 --> 01:29:20,013
Incoming!

756
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:25,084
Don't run, fight!

757
01:29:26,692 --> 01:29:28,857
We're in deep Fremen shit.

758
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:32,130
Holy Mother.

759
01:29:43,407 --> 01:29:44,439
Oh, fuck.

760
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:04,264
I recognized your footsteps...

761
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,063
- old man.
- No.

762
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,657
You young pup.

763
01:30:33,226 --> 01:30:34,786
You young pup!

764
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:44,397
Mmm. After the Battle of Arrakeen,

765
01:30:44,532 --> 01:30:48,442
I was able to negotiate a trip
back home for the survivors.

766
01:30:49,474 --> 01:30:51,407
Thanks to these guys.

767
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:52,941
Why'd you stay?

768
01:30:53,775 --> 01:30:55,449
Well, I wanted blood.

769
01:30:57,449 --> 01:30:58,749
Rabban's head?

770
01:30:59,888 --> 01:31:01,347
Mm-hmm.

771
01:31:01,482 --> 01:31:04,690
Well, since Muad'Dib's
been driving Rabban crazy,

772
01:31:04,825 --> 01:31:09,591
the smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

773
01:31:09,726 --> 01:31:11,729
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

774
01:31:13,695 --> 01:31:15,930
Paul Muad'Dib.

775
01:31:16,065 --> 01:31:18,967
I've heard many stories about Muad'Dib.

776
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:21,640
None of them pretty.

777
01:31:22,673 --> 01:31:24,170
You see the fear?

778
01:31:25,778 --> 01:31:27,811
When our resources are limited...

779
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:32,112
fear is all we have.

780
01:31:49,633 --> 01:31:50,996
How many men with you?

781
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:53,236
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

782
01:31:57,912 --> 01:32:01,042
Do you realize what you're
able to achieve with 200 men?

783
01:32:02,349 --> 01:32:03,781
Incredible fighters.

784
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:05,348
Duncan said there were millions of them.

785
01:32:05,484 --> 01:32:06,979
In the Deep South, yes.

786
01:32:07,114 --> 01:32:09,254
Well, what are you waiting for?

787
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,052
With thousands of these guys,

788
01:32:11,053 --> 01:32:12,692
you could take control
of the entire planet.

789
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:14,754
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of?

790
01:32:14,889 --> 01:32:16,090
Hey!

791
01:32:18,198 --> 01:32:19,896
Worship, Gurney.

792
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:22,536
They used to be friends.

793
01:32:23,964 --> 01:32:25,303
Now they're followers.

794
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,406
Muad'Dib, the Prophet.

795
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:29,373
Why is that a bad thing? Use it.

796
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:31,375
It's not that simple.

797
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:34,379
You have the power to avenge your
father, and you're afraid to use it?

798
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:36,715
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

799
01:32:37,483 --> 01:32:39,014
I can foresee things.

800
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:44,449
If I go South, all my
visions lead to horror.

801
01:32:44,584 --> 01:32:48,193
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

802
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:49,827
All dying because of me.

803
01:32:50,662 --> 01:32:51,994
Because you lose control.

804
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:55,129
Because I gain it.

805
01:33:13,816 --> 01:33:15,182
That's a lot of water.

806
01:33:17,751 --> 01:33:19,087
Chani.

807
01:33:19,223 --> 01:33:21,023
What? Look at him, he's hopeless.

808
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:22,827
He's family.

809
01:33:26,298 --> 01:33:27,298
Really?

810
01:33:37,809 --> 01:33:39,778
What do you think of the outsider?

811
01:33:42,364 --> 01:33:44,700
I think he's trouble.

812
01:33:46,146 --> 01:33:48,050
No, I trust Usul.

813
01:33:55,159 --> 01:33:57,862
No need to be a prophet
to see what's ahead.

814
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:02,130
Your path leads to war.

815
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,968
You know that.

816
01:34:07,374 --> 01:34:09,238
So, war is coming.

817
01:34:09,374 --> 01:34:13,244
What will you do when you
feel its breath upon your neck?

818
01:34:16,676 --> 01:34:19,044
If you don't want to
raise an army in the South,

819
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,017
you may still have an option.

820
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:25,384
Fire power...

821
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:28,794
which you don't have.

822
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,929
And here I am.

823
01:34:36,201 --> 01:34:38,936
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

824
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:47,142
Every House possesses an atomic arsenal.

825
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:50,442
I thought ours had been lost.

826
01:34:52,514 --> 01:34:55,282
It's huge, Chani. It
could change everything.

827
01:35:00,357 --> 01:35:03,928
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

828
01:35:05,496 --> 01:35:09,098
He who can destroy a thing
has the real control of it.

829
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:12,266
So, you can control it and not us?

830
01:35:14,336 --> 01:35:16,336
You promised me you didn't want power.

831
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,944
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

832
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:23,046
'Cause you're a foreigner.
Like your friend.

833
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:26,984
I'm not a foreigner.

834
01:35:34,592 --> 01:35:35,758
Not to me.

835
01:35:35,893 --> 01:35:37,764
But to the desert, you are.

836
01:35:38,664 --> 01:35:40,866
My allegiance is to you.

837
01:35:41,534 --> 01:35:42,633
To the Fremen.

838
01:35:42,769 --> 01:35:44,771
I'm doing this for all of us.

839
01:35:46,033 --> 01:35:47,103
Do you believe me?

840
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,915
I'll talk to Stilgar.

841
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:06,023
There.

842
01:36:10,061 --> 01:36:13,459
It's right under everybody's noses.

843
01:36:14,731 --> 01:36:15,894
Not clever.

844
01:36:16,029 --> 01:36:17,497
That's the idea.

845
01:36:17,633 --> 01:36:20,235
Nobody would ever look in
there because it's obvious.

846
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:24,573
Not clever.

847
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:26,074
Did you find it?

848
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:28,479
I didn't look for it.

849
01:36:28,615 --> 01:36:30,080
How many heads exactly?

850
01:36:31,545 --> 01:36:33,886
Enough to blow up the whole planet.

851
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:38,319
It's a figure of speech.

852
01:36:40,022 --> 01:36:41,256
You know what I mean.

853
01:37:03,644 --> 01:37:05,951
Only with your genetic heritage.

854
01:37:45,423 --> 01:37:48,820
Your great-great- grandfather's legacy.

855
01:37:48,956 --> 01:37:53,064
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

856
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:59,169
Now that, that is power.

857
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:09,942
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.

858
01:38:10,077 --> 01:38:12,250
Eighth comment.

859
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:15,947
Reports from the south
of Arrakis arrive rarely.

860
01:38:16,082 --> 01:38:19,686
These are barren, burnt
lands hidden by sandstorms

861
01:38:19,822 --> 01:38:22,489
which stretch a thousand
miles across the equator.

862
01:38:24,295 --> 01:38:27,931
Nothing can live there without faith.

863
01:38:28,066 --> 01:38:31,308
Which is why our Bene
Gesserit missionaries

864
01:38:31,309 --> 01:38:32,532
have been so productive there.

865
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,538
Through them, we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure

866
01:38:38,673 --> 01:38:40,441
taking grip on the imaginations

867
01:38:40,576 --> 01:38:44,050
of the Southern fundamentalist tribes.

868
01:38:44,185 --> 01:38:47,520
A new Reverend Mother from the North...

869
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:51,858
spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the Lisan al-Gaib,

870
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:54,753
"The Voice from the Outer World."

871
01:38:54,889 --> 01:38:58,058
With religious fervor
rising in the South,

872
01:38:58,194 --> 01:39:01,893
and Muad'Dib strangling
spice production in the North,

873
01:39:02,028 --> 01:39:05,939
everything points to
the escalation of war.

874
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:15,047
Only one at a time...

875
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:19,659
or they fight each other to death.

876
01:39:21,328 --> 01:39:22,913
How old?

877
01:39:23,288 --> 01:39:24,331
Very young.

878
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:26,690
Hmm.

879
01:39:28,668 --> 01:39:31,046
My daughter asks, how is it done?

880
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:37,201
Quiet.

881
01:41:20,363 --> 01:41:23,325
The Water of Life.

882
01:41:26,043 --> 01:41:27,542
Listen carefully.

883
01:41:27,677 --> 01:41:29,279
Soon a man is going to visit your temple

884
01:41:29,415 --> 01:41:32,049
and he may want you
to perform the rites.

885
01:41:32,184 --> 01:41:35,016
Reverend Mother, it is forbidden.

886
01:41:35,152 --> 01:41:37,222
You question the prophecy?

887
01:41:37,881 --> 01:41:40,050
No man will survive.

888
01:41:40,454 --> 01:41:42,491
Let him try!

889
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,767
What the hell?

890
01:42:31,172 --> 01:42:32,607
Chani!

891
01:42:38,382 --> 01:42:39,878
Chani!

892
01:42:43,954 --> 01:42:44,954
Chani.

893
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:56,295
Sietch Tabr.

894
01:43:20,691 --> 01:43:22,591
Old fashioned artillery.

895
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:25,363
Genius.

896
01:43:25,498 --> 01:43:28,026
We're literally melting
rock on their heads.

897
01:43:28,161 --> 01:43:31,098
I want to go on the
ground. Prepare my troops.

898
01:43:31,234 --> 01:43:34,500
My Lord. I would recommend
you stay inside. There was...

899
01:43:34,636 --> 01:43:36,675
Bring his body to my quarters.

900
01:43:37,737 --> 01:43:39,772
My poor darlings are hungry.

901
01:43:39,908 --> 01:43:41,973
There was no food for
them on the flight.

902
01:43:43,381 --> 01:43:45,713
What are you doing here?

903
01:43:45,848 --> 01:43:48,986
It's early morning.
What are you doing here?

904
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:50,890
Kiss my feet, brother.

905
01:43:51,025 --> 01:43:52,025
I'm gonna eviscerate your...

906
01:43:57,893 --> 01:44:00,761
You humiliated our family.

907
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:03,665
You humiliated me.

908
01:44:04,672 --> 01:44:05,731
Kiss...

909
01:44:05,867 --> 01:44:07,867
or die.

910
01:44:18,148 --> 01:44:19,450
We're even now.

911
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:28,261
Embarrass our family one more time...

912
01:44:29,326 --> 01:44:30,692
it will be the last.

913
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:02,493
They're all dead!

914
01:45:03,962 --> 01:45:05,590
I lost them all in the fire!

915
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:07,998
They didn't even engage on the ground,

916
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:10,200
like honorable fighters.

917
01:45:11,966 --> 01:45:14,472
The whole of the North has been hit.

918
01:45:19,352 --> 01:45:22,313
There is a call for a
war council in the South.

919
01:45:22,438 --> 01:45:24,857
Every leader must attend.

920
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,651
Muad'Dib, they're waiting for you.

921
01:45:42,632 --> 01:45:45,567
Usul, in the South...

922
01:45:45,703 --> 01:45:48,407
only leaders are allowed to speak.

923
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:52,069
- You must take my place.
- I can't do that.

924
01:45:52,205 --> 01:45:55,007
It is a good time to
cross blades with me.

925
01:45:55,142 --> 01:45:58,546
I am weak. I am an easy kill, Muad'Dib.

926
01:45:58,681 --> 01:46:00,446
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

927
01:46:00,581 --> 01:46:03,114
We need you. We need the Lisan
al-Gaib to lead our people.

928
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:05,083
You know what I think
of all that, Stilgar.

929
01:46:05,218 --> 01:46:08,020
I don't care what you
believe. I believe.

930
01:46:22,406 --> 01:46:23,871
I didn't see it coming.

931
01:46:25,577 --> 01:46:27,512
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

932
01:46:28,414 --> 01:46:30,443
They just went back to reload.

933
01:46:30,579 --> 01:46:32,351
We're setting thumpers.

934
01:46:32,486 --> 01:46:33,715
We're moving everyone to the South.

935
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:35,654
I'll stay behind and cover your retreat.

936
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:38,424
- What are you talking about?
- Chani, I can't go with you.

937
01:46:39,092 --> 01:46:40,284
You know why.

938
01:46:40,419 --> 01:46:42,289
- I'll stay, too.
- Nobody stays but me.

939
01:46:42,424 --> 01:46:45,095
- Paul.
- That's an order, Gurney Halleck! Go South!

940
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,597
Protect my mother.

941
01:46:48,832 --> 01:46:50,067
- My Lord.
- Muad'Dib.

942
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:51,602
None of these people
will leave without you.

943
01:46:52,945 --> 01:46:55,657
I can't go South.

944
01:47:00,008 --> 01:47:02,041
He's afraid of the fundamentalists.

945
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:04,582
And he should be.

946
01:47:17,827 --> 01:47:19,432
Don't resist.

947
01:47:26,469 --> 01:47:28,133
Talk to me, Jamis.

948
01:47:38,817 --> 01:47:42,887
You see only fragments.

949
01:47:43,022 --> 01:47:47,152
You cannot see the future
without seeing the past.

950
01:47:48,922 --> 01:47:53,661
To unlock your mind, you need
to drink the Water of Life...

951
01:47:53,796 --> 01:47:56,931
and you will see everything.

952
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:04,037
A good hunter always climbs the
highest dune before his hunt.

953
01:48:05,443 --> 01:48:06,809
He needs to see...

954
01:48:08,579 --> 01:48:10,241
as far as he can see.

955
01:48:15,451 --> 01:48:16,786
You need to see.

956
01:48:19,254 --> 01:48:21,692
You must drink the Water of Life.

957
01:48:22,792 --> 01:48:24,695
Your mind, it's gonna open,

958
01:48:26,728 --> 01:48:28,633
and you will see.

959
01:48:46,817 --> 01:48:48,950
The world has made choices for us.

960
01:48:53,857 --> 01:48:55,522
If I go South, I might lose you.

961
01:48:55,658 --> 01:48:57,629
You will never lose me,

962
01:48:58,726 --> 01:49:00,093
Paul Atreides.

963
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,295
Not as long as you stay who you are.

964
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:13,605
I'll cross the storms with you.

965
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:15,207
Go South.

966
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,078
Bring your people to safety.

967
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,922
And then I will do what must be done.

968
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:52,150
Where?

969
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:54,548
Spy. Left behind.

970
01:49:54,684 --> 01:49:56,318
No trace of the others.

971
01:49:56,453 --> 01:49:59,284
They've gone South
to hide in the storms.

972
01:50:03,928 --> 01:50:05,563
Send this message to the Baron.

973
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:07,892
The North is liberated and secured.

974
01:50:08,027 --> 01:50:10,464
Harvest spice at will.

975
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,132
Yes, na-Baron.

976
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:30,152
You killed nine of my
men with one single blade.

977
01:50:31,623 --> 01:50:33,152
She won't talk.

978
01:50:33,287 --> 01:50:35,155
Tell her that's fine.

979
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:37,927
I already know
everything I need to know.

980
01:50:45,735 --> 01:50:47,772
Only pleasure remains.

981
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:57,303
You're not allowed in here, stranger.

982
01:51:59,377 --> 01:52:01,420
Leave or die.

983
01:52:02,838 --> 01:52:05,549
I should be welcomed...

984
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:13,516
If you drink, you shall die.

985
01:52:14,266 --> 01:52:18,354
If you drink, you may see.

986
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:57,033
Now that you can see our past,

987
01:53:00,101 --> 01:53:03,369
you can see your future.

988
01:53:24,196 --> 01:53:27,966
Oh, brother, my dearest brother,

989
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:31,100
you are not prepared
for what is to come.

990
01:53:32,535 --> 01:53:35,940
You'll now learn the
truth about our family.

991
01:53:36,075 --> 01:53:39,845
And it will hurt you to the core.

992
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:43,042
Paul...

993
01:53:43,178 --> 01:53:46,445
Don't worry. I'm with you.

994
01:53:47,783 --> 01:53:49,349
I love you.

995
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,091
Who knows about this?

996
01:53:55,159 --> 01:53:56,577
Only you, Reverend Mother.

997
01:53:56,702 --> 01:53:57,702
Good.

998
01:53:58,162 --> 01:53:59,413
Here are the others?

999
01:53:59,498 --> 01:54:01,295
They just arrived from the North.

1000
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:03,902
Find them.

1001
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:34,328
Paul?

1002
01:54:34,895 --> 01:54:36,132
Paul.

1003
01:54:38,165 --> 01:54:40,668
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

1004
01:54:44,171 --> 01:54:45,636
What happened?

1005
01:54:47,008 --> 01:54:48,507
What happened?

1006
01:54:58,953 --> 01:55:00,388
He's dead.

1007
01:55:00,523 --> 01:55:03,361
His vital signs are so
low, they can't be detected.

1008
01:55:03,496 --> 01:55:04,660
But he's alive.

1009
01:55:04,796 --> 01:55:06,492
What did you do to him?

1010
01:55:07,561 --> 01:55:09,765
No, not that. Why would he do that?

1011
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,900
Why would you do that?

1012
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,334
Because He is the One.

1013
01:55:14,113 --> 01:55:18,784
The Lisan al-Gaib should find His
way to where no man has ever been.

1014
01:55:19,034 --> 01:55:20,147
You're insane!

1015
01:55:20,148 --> 01:55:23,546
Chani, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

1016
01:55:23,681 --> 01:55:25,082
You do it.

1017
01:55:26,048 --> 01:55:27,048
You did this to him.

1018
01:55:27,183 --> 01:55:28,749
You did this to your own son!

1019
01:55:28,884 --> 01:55:29,884
You do it!

1020
01:55:29,984 --> 01:55:31,720
Fix it yourself.

1021
01:55:31,855 --> 01:55:35,285
Chani, you might not believe in the
prophecy, but you're a part of it.

1022
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:37,028
You're the poison.

1023
01:55:37,163 --> 01:55:39,761
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

1024
01:55:39,896 --> 01:55:41,263
Do it.

1025
01:55:51,106 --> 01:55:53,885
He shall come back

1026
01:55:53,886 --> 01:55:58,407
from the dead with Desert Spring tears.

1027
01:56:01,076 --> 01:56:03,579
Bring me a drop of Water of Life.

1028
01:56:04,384 --> 01:56:05,483
As written.

1029
01:56:05,618 --> 01:56:07,223
Desert Spring tears.

1030
01:56:31,315 --> 01:56:34,651
Kwisatz Haderach,

1031
01:56:34,787 --> 01:56:38,619
climb up. Arise.

1032
01:56:48,198 --> 01:56:50,200
Usul, I'm here. I'm here.

1033
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:00,938
Are you okay?

1034
01:57:01,074 --> 01:57:02,278
Yes.

1035
01:57:11,185 --> 01:57:12,216
Are you sure?

1036
01:57:16,597 --> 01:57:18,030
Thanks to you.

1037
01:58:03,473 --> 01:58:05,275
I'm sorry about Chani.

1038
01:58:06,572 --> 01:58:08,674
She'll come to understand.

1039
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:10,808
I've seen it.

1040
01:58:12,247 --> 01:58:14,114
You can see?

1041
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:16,715
The visions are clear now.

1042
01:58:18,686 --> 01:58:22,688
I see possible futures. All at once.

1043
01:58:23,656 --> 01:58:27,097
Our enemies are all around us.

1044
01:58:27,233 --> 01:58:29,761
And in so many futures, they prevail.

1045
01:58:30,496 --> 01:58:32,566
But I do see a way.

1046
01:58:33,567 --> 01:58:36,174
There is a narrow way through.

1047
01:58:46,249 --> 01:58:48,285
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

1048
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:50,881
Written across time.

1049
01:59:03,163 --> 01:59:06,369
You are the daughter of
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

1050
01:59:09,073 --> 01:59:10,670
Did my father know?

1051
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:19,877
I didn't know myself, until
I took the worm's poison.

1052
01:59:27,552 --> 01:59:29,392
We're Harkonnens.

1053
01:59:33,264 --> 01:59:35,530
So this is how we'll survive.

1054
01:59:37,101 --> 01:59:38,731
By being Harkonnens.

1055
02:01:15,561 --> 02:01:16,796
We must talk.

1056
02:01:18,636 --> 02:01:21,436
Stilgar, you can stop
this. Do you hear me?

1057
02:01:21,572 --> 02:01:23,169
You have the power to stop this.

1058
02:01:23,304 --> 02:01:24,706
Northern woman!

1059
02:01:24,841 --> 02:01:26,575
You are not allowed to
speak inside the circle.

1060
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:28,278
If you want to speak,
you know what to do.

1061
02:01:28,413 --> 02:01:31,811
Stilgar, please. For Arrakis' sake.

1062
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:47,163
This prophecy is how they enslave us!

1063
02:01:47,298 --> 02:01:49,299
How they dominate...

1064
02:01:49,435 --> 02:01:51,136
You'll get yourself in trouble.

1065
02:01:51,271 --> 02:01:52,600
This is none of your business.

1066
02:01:52,736 --> 02:01:54,636
Rabban Harkonnen
himself killed my family.

1067
02:01:54,771 --> 02:01:56,634
He gave me this scar to remember him by.

1068
02:01:56,769 --> 02:01:58,908
This is all of my business.

1069
02:02:45,819 --> 02:02:47,819
Only tribe leaders can speak.

1070
02:02:47,955 --> 02:02:49,954
If you wish to share your voice,

1071
02:02:50,089 --> 02:02:52,923
you must take his place by defeating him

1072
02:02:53,059 --> 02:02:55,361
and returning his water to the well.

1073
02:02:55,497 --> 02:02:59,470
You think I'm stupid enough to
deprive myself of the best of us?

1074
02:03:00,139 --> 02:03:02,374
Do you smash a knife before battle?

1075
02:03:03,506 --> 02:03:05,536
Take my life, Usul.

1076
02:03:05,672 --> 02:03:07,605
It is the only way.

1077
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:09,573
I'm pointing the way!

1078
02:03:12,085 --> 02:03:13,314
Slow down.

1079
02:03:13,449 --> 02:03:16,312
There is no one in this room

1080
02:03:16,313 --> 02:03:19,420
who can stand against me!

1081
02:03:32,277 --> 02:03:36,073
Your mothers warned you about my coming!

1082
02:03:37,407 --> 02:03:39,102
Fear the moment.

1083
02:03:48,983 --> 02:03:51,423
But you think you could have a chance.

1084
02:03:53,489 --> 02:03:55,757
But you're afraid.

1085
02:03:57,344 --> 02:03:59,805
What if I could be the One?

1086
02:04:00,764 --> 02:04:05,018
This could be the moment you've
been praying for, all your life.

1087
02:04:07,688 --> 02:04:11,733
You're praying now, to your grandmother.

1088
02:04:12,109 --> 02:04:15,946
She died nine moons ago.

1089
02:04:18,323 --> 02:04:19,991
She lost an eye.

1090
02:04:20,325 --> 02:04:24,121
A rock smashed her face as
she was crossing the Belt.

1091
02:04:24,955 --> 02:04:27,666
She was 12 when it happened.

1092
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:32,796
At that time, this
world had a Fremen name.

1093
02:04:35,297 --> 02:04:36,626
Dune.

1094
02:04:36,762 --> 02:04:38,130
Lisan al-Gaib!

1095
02:04:38,265 --> 02:04:40,598
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1096
02:04:42,207 --> 02:04:43,640
Lisan al-Gaib!

1097
02:04:47,853 --> 02:04:52,357
In your nightmares, you
give water to the dead,

1098
02:04:52,649 --> 02:04:54,443
and it brings joy to your heart!

1099
02:04:54,616 --> 02:04:55,616
Muad'Dib!

1100
02:04:55,718 --> 02:04:57,786
Muad'Dib.

1101
02:05:01,525 --> 02:05:02,758
Mahdi, what do you foresee for us?

1102
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:08,758
Green Paradise.

1103
02:05:11,543 --> 02:05:16,089
Lisan al-Gaib, show us the Way!

1104
02:05:21,944 --> 02:05:24,208
This is my father's ducal signet.

1105
02:05:34,187 --> 02:05:37,093
I am Paul Muad'Dib Atreides,

1106
02:05:37,228 --> 02:05:39,058
Duke of Arrakis.

1107
02:05:40,233 --> 02:05:42,094
The Hand of God be my witness!

1108
02:05:42,949 --> 02:05:45,410
I am the Voice from the Outer World!

1109
02:05:45,702 --> 02:05:48,079
I will lead you to paradise!

1110
02:05:48,135 --> 02:05:49,773
Lisan al-Gaib!

1111
02:05:49,908 --> 02:05:51,903
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1112
02:05:52,038 --> 02:05:56,072
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1113
02:05:56,207 --> 02:05:59,009
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1114
02:05:59,144 --> 02:06:02,012
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1115
02:06:02,147 --> 02:06:05,323
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1116
02:06:05,458 --> 02:06:08,520
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1117
02:06:08,656 --> 02:06:10,287
Lisan al-Gaib!

1118
02:06:47,426 --> 02:06:50,096
Paul Atreides is still alive.

1119
02:06:51,667 --> 02:06:53,363
He challenges my father.

1120
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,608
You've never been on Arrakis.

1121
02:06:57,875 --> 02:06:59,774
It's quite impressive. You'll see.

1122
02:06:59,909 --> 02:07:01,407
Was this all upon your advice?

1123
02:07:01,542 --> 02:07:03,276
What?

1124
02:07:03,412 --> 02:07:06,344
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

1125
02:07:06,479 --> 02:07:09,918
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

1126
02:07:10,053 --> 02:07:12,389
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

1127
02:07:12,525 --> 02:07:14,285
And I was right to do it.

1128
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,659
The Kwisatz Haderach is a form of power

1129
02:07:17,795 --> 02:07:19,922
that our world has not yet seen.

1130
02:07:20,058 --> 02:07:22,562
The ultimate power.

1131
02:07:22,698 --> 02:07:24,227
For ninety generations,

1132
02:07:24,362 --> 02:07:26,335
we have supervised House Atreides.

1133
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:29,606
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

1134
02:07:29,742 --> 02:07:33,073
Their bloodline had to be terminated.

1135
02:07:33,209 --> 02:07:35,575
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

1136
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,710
Several prospects.

1137
02:07:36,778 --> 02:07:38,313
But it's backfired.

1138
02:07:38,449 --> 02:07:39,849
Paul is alive.

1139
02:07:39,984 --> 02:07:41,612
And if he defeats
Feyd-Rautha, my father...

1140
02:07:41,748 --> 02:07:46,055
Your father will lose the
throne no matter who prevails.

1141
02:07:46,191 --> 02:07:49,093
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

1142
02:07:49,228 --> 02:07:52,862
and, through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

1143
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,799
One. Way.

1144
02:07:56,434 --> 02:07:58,430
Are you prepared?

1145
02:07:58,566 --> 02:08:01,673
You've been preparing me my
whole life, Reverend Mother.

1146
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:06,176
You're heading north with the others?

1147
02:08:06,312 --> 02:08:07,737
I'm Fedaykin.

1148
02:08:07,873 --> 02:08:10,679
I follow my leaders. If
fighting goes north, I go north.

1149
02:08:10,814 --> 02:08:12,075
Paul didn't have a choice, Chani.

1150
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:14,748
I won't be fighting for him.

1151
02:08:14,883 --> 02:08:16,380
I'm fighting for my people.

1152
02:08:20,056 --> 02:08:22,089
I came to wish you best of luck.

1153
02:08:23,154 --> 02:08:24,927
I'd wish you the same,

1154
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:28,458
but it seems you've won your battle.

1155
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:53,087
He took the bait.

1156
02:08:59,425 --> 02:09:01,766
Oh, the Emperor's very obliging.

1157
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:04,362
He's right on time.

1158
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:07,365
As you foresaw, Muad'Dib...

1159
02:09:09,531 --> 02:09:11,324
a great-grandmother of a storm.

1160
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:39,331
What is he doing here?

1161
02:09:39,466 --> 02:09:41,971
I brought spice
production under control.

1162
02:09:44,938 --> 02:09:46,305
What do we do?

1163
02:09:47,473 --> 02:09:50,277
Send messages to the Great Houses.

1164
02:09:50,412 --> 02:09:54,346
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

1165
02:09:54,481 --> 02:09:57,547
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

1166
02:10:21,481 --> 02:10:23,408
He brought his whole army.

1167
02:10:24,511 --> 02:10:27,115
When the storm hits this ridge,

1168
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:29,413
Gurney will open the
way for you, Stilgar,

1169
02:10:29,548 --> 02:10:31,920
so you can enter the basin from the West

1170
02:10:32,056 --> 02:10:34,286
and distract their defense systems.

1171
02:10:34,421 --> 02:10:36,121
Chani, I want you and your Fedaykin

1172
02:10:36,257 --> 02:10:37,961
to then attack from the East,

1173
02:10:38,728 --> 02:10:40,458
inside the basin.

1174
02:10:40,593 --> 02:10:42,798
I'll strike from the North, head on,

1175
02:10:42,933 --> 02:10:44,900
with the Fundamentalist troops.

1176
02:10:45,036 --> 02:10:47,772
And I'll serve Arrakeen for dessert.

1177
02:10:47,907 --> 02:10:50,270
Remember, I need the Emperor alive.

1178
02:10:51,038 --> 02:10:53,376
Long live the fighters.

1179
02:11:50,534 --> 02:11:51,534
Hm.

1180
02:11:59,676 --> 02:12:01,673
Baron,

1181
02:12:01,809 --> 02:12:06,545
do you have any idea who
this Muad'Dib could be?

1182
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,751
Some fanatic, your
Majesty. That's all we know.

1183
02:12:09,887 --> 02:12:11,784
More. More. Give me more.

1184
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:12,954
He's a madman!

1185
02:12:13,089 --> 02:12:15,256
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

1186
02:12:17,424 --> 02:12:19,559
That's all you know?

1187
02:12:19,695 --> 02:12:21,360
Really?

1188
02:12:21,496 --> 02:12:23,429
Muad'Dib is dead.

1189
02:12:25,533 --> 02:12:28,639
Or he went hiding in the Southern storms

1190
02:12:28,774 --> 02:12:30,341
which means the same thing.

1191
02:12:30,476 --> 02:12:32,436
- They speak the truth.
- Your Majesty,

1192
02:12:32,572 --> 02:12:34,009
the sand storm that's approaching

1193
02:12:34,145 --> 02:12:36,440
threatens the integrity of our shields.

1194
02:12:36,576 --> 02:12:38,479
We recommend going back into orbit.

1195
02:12:38,615 --> 02:12:40,985
Well, the mountains will
protect us from most of it,

1196
02:12:41,818 --> 02:12:43,218
your Majesty.

1197
02:12:44,616 --> 02:12:48,859
Baron, have you ever investigated

1198
02:12:48,994 --> 02:12:52,226
the south regions of Arrakis?

1199
02:12:52,362 --> 02:12:54,963
Well, the entire
region is uninhabitable.

1200
02:12:55,098 --> 02:12:57,494
It's well known, your Majesty.

1201
02:12:57,630 --> 02:13:01,839
Your uninhabited South

1202
02:13:01,975 --> 02:13:04,940
exhibits evidence of human activity.

1203
02:13:05,075 --> 02:13:07,275
I wasn't aware of this.

1204
02:13:07,410 --> 02:13:09,842
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

1205
02:13:14,954 --> 02:13:16,581
Muad'Dib is alive.

1206
02:13:17,853 --> 02:13:19,254
I must find him.

1207
02:14:33,964 --> 02:14:36,194
Long live the fighters!

1208
02:14:39,703 --> 02:14:41,204
Fire!

1209
02:15:20,672 --> 02:15:23,041
Sardaukar! On guard!

1210
02:19:36,894 --> 02:19:38,094
Sardaukar!

1211
02:20:43,397 --> 02:20:44,963
Grandfather.

1212
02:21:06,884 --> 02:21:08,690
You die like an animal.

1213
02:21:39,718 --> 02:21:40,953
Muad'Dib.

1214
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:43,593
Bring the prisoners to the Residency.

1215
02:21:45,411 --> 02:21:47,580
Kill the Sardaukar.

1216
02:21:50,166 --> 02:21:52,668
Give the Baron's body to the desert.

1217
02:23:10,445 --> 02:23:11,747
Rabban!

1218
02:23:22,659 --> 02:23:24,628
Look who's back from the dead.

1219
02:23:38,773 --> 02:23:42,305
For my Duke, and my friends.

1220
02:24:47,742 --> 02:24:48,976
Warships.

1221
02:24:51,316 --> 02:24:52,408
The Great Houses.

1222
02:24:53,786 --> 02:24:56,147
Gurney, it's time. Bring the prisoners.

1223
02:24:56,282 --> 02:24:59,783
My Lord.

1224
02:25:23,745 --> 02:25:25,111
This isn't over yet.

1225
02:25:30,917 --> 02:25:32,349
I want you to know...

1226
02:25:35,090 --> 02:25:37,288
I will love you as long as I breathe.

1227
02:25:49,301 --> 02:25:51,973
There is a massed armada in orbit.

1228
02:25:55,176 --> 02:25:58,644
You're facing a full invasion, Fremen.

1229
02:25:58,779 --> 02:26:02,280
How can you be so sure the
Great Houses are here for me?

1230
02:26:07,855 --> 02:26:12,261
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

1231
02:26:12,397 --> 02:26:17,163
I am Paul Atreides, son of
Leto Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1232
02:26:18,801 --> 02:26:20,162
- Gurney.
- My Lord.

1233
02:26:20,297 --> 02:26:22,472
Send a warning to all ships.

1234
02:26:22,608 --> 02:26:23,895
If the Great Houses attack,

1235
02:26:23,896 --> 02:26:26,843
our atomics will
obliterate all spice fields.

1236
02:26:28,144 --> 02:26:30,540
- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

1237
02:26:30,675 --> 02:26:32,641
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

1238
02:26:32,777 --> 02:26:35,284
Silence!

1239
02:26:37,556 --> 02:26:39,053
Abomination.

1240
02:26:43,088 --> 02:26:44,861
Message sent, my Lord.

1241
02:26:46,495 --> 02:26:50,163
As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

1242
02:26:50,299 --> 02:26:54,101
Your feet? You'll be
lucky to keep your head.

1243
02:26:57,139 --> 02:26:58,974
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1244
02:27:01,271 --> 02:27:03,176
She will remain safe.

1245
02:27:03,311 --> 02:27:05,849
And we will rule
together over the Empire.

1246
02:27:15,724 --> 02:27:17,157
But you...

1247
02:27:19,832 --> 02:27:21,590
You have to answer for my father.

1248
02:27:29,037 --> 02:27:32,975
Do you know why I killed him?

1249
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,911
Because he was a man

1250
02:27:36,047 --> 02:27:38,211
who believed in the rules of the heart.

1251
02:27:39,379 --> 02:27:41,478
But the heart is not meant to rule.

1252
02:27:42,883 --> 02:27:44,118
In other words...

1253
02:27:46,317 --> 02:27:50,190
your father was a weak man.

1254
02:27:59,067 --> 02:28:02,301
Stand or choose your champion.

1255
02:28:04,943 --> 02:28:06,569
I am here, Atreides.

1256
02:28:08,941 --> 02:28:10,280
I need a blade.

1257
02:28:10,415 --> 02:28:12,047
Accept mine.

1258
02:28:23,654 --> 02:28:26,760
Do not stain your hands on this animal.

1259
02:28:26,895 --> 02:28:28,123
Let me deal with him.

1260
02:28:28,259 --> 02:28:30,197
It's my burden, Gurney.

1261
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,916
Why does he take such risks?

1262
02:28:51,052 --> 02:28:53,550
Muad'Dib leads the way.

1263
02:29:17,214 --> 02:29:20,709
I'm happy to finally meet you, cousin.

1264
02:29:21,950 --> 02:29:24,988
Cousin? Is that right?

1265
02:29:26,852 --> 02:29:32,160
Well, you wouldn't be the
first relative I've killed.

1266
02:29:34,558 --> 02:29:37,594
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1267
02:29:40,634 --> 02:29:45,173
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1268
02:30:35,786 --> 02:30:39,029
She's your pet?

1269
02:30:53,606 --> 02:30:57,179
Any special attention for the pet?

1270
02:32:23,694 --> 02:32:25,795
You have fought well, Atreides.

1271
02:32:33,338 --> 02:32:34,806
Lisan al-Gaib!

1272
02:32:34,941 --> 02:32:37,477
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1273
02:33:29,795 --> 02:33:32,396
You should've believed.

1274
02:33:32,532 --> 02:33:34,369
You chose the wrong side.

1275
02:33:35,469 --> 02:33:36,833
Side?

1276
02:33:36,968 --> 02:33:39,936
You, of all people, should know.

1277
02:33:40,071 --> 02:33:44,841
There are no sides... Reverend Mother.

1278
02:34:04,035 --> 02:34:05,668
The life debt has been paid.

1279
02:34:05,803 --> 02:34:07,496
Spare my father now and I
will be your willing bride.

1280
02:34:07,632 --> 02:34:09,371
The throne will be yours.

1281
02:35:41,729 --> 02:35:44,993
My Lord, the Great Houses have answered.

1282
02:35:45,129 --> 02:35:47,436
They refuse to honor your ascendancy.

1283
02:35:48,736 --> 02:35:52,067
We await your orders, Lisan al-Gaib.

1284
02:36:01,151 --> 02:36:02,679
Lead them to Paradise.

1285
02:36:02,814 --> 02:36:04,212
Lisan al-Gaib!

1286
02:36:04,347 --> 02:36:06,950
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1287
02:36:21,738 --> 02:36:25,606
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1288
02:36:33,946 --> 02:36:35,946
What is happening, Mother?

1289
02:36:37,819 --> 02:36:40,522
Your brother attacks the Great Houses.

1290
02:36:44,062 --> 02:36:46,495
The Holy War begins.

1291
